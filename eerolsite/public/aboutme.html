                    My name is Eero Lehtinen. I'm <span id="age">an 18</span> year old Finnish man passionately interested in creating software. 
                    I have always been baffled about how electric signals in computers could produce such impressive results. 
                    I was determined to find out how they worked. 
                    Back then I wasn't smart enough to find out anything.
            </p>
            <p>
                    However, in 7th grade I was introduced to Scratch in a programming class. 
                    I created my first simple games and was instantly hooked. 
                    After that, I have been studying computer programming on my own without sacrificing on my academic performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                    I graduated <span class="tooltip"><span class="tooltiptext">Three years of optional education<br>starting after nine years of<br>compulsory education in Finland</span>"lukio"</span> in 2018 with excellent results from the final tests. 
                    I got an <span class="tooltip"><span class="tooltiptext">Laudatur: top 5% of all candidates</span>L</span> in math, English and chemistry. 
                    Also, I got an <span class="tooltip"><span class="tooltiptext">Eximia cum laude approbatur: top 15% of all candidates</span>E</span> in Finnish and physics. 
                    I was quickly selected to the Tampere University of Technology to study information technology. 
                    I didn't even have to go to the entrance examination thanks to my great final exam scores. 
                    I would say that perseverance and refined analytical thinking are my best features.
                    They have brought me this far in life.
            </p>
            <p>
                My programming studies haven't gone to waste: I have made multiple intriguing personal projects on my free time. 
                They are very diverse ranging from simple browser extensions running on javascript to complex C++ multiplayer games requiring intricate networking.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm currently serving in The Finnish Defence Forces. I'm planning to stay there for about 9 months, after wich I can continue my studies in university.
