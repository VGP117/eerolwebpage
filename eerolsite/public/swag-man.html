            <p>
                The purpose of Swag-man was to imitate classic Pac-Man as closely as possible in Java and make it happen in about two weeks.
                I recreated all the original game mechanics with the help of <a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/132330/the_pacman_dossier.php?page=1" alt="Gamasutra article explaining Pac-Man">this Gamasutra article</a>.
                Only feature i couldn't bring myself to do was the glitching when reaching level 256. 
                My Swag-man continues chomping forever. 
                At least until the level counter overflows at 2,147,483,648.
                Also my version runs at 100 fps while the original runs at 60 fps, wich makes some bugs like passing through ghosts less likely to happen on my version.

                Don't worry about this message. My downloads don't contain any viruses/bloatware/etc. Your antivirus will most likely warn you anyway.
                This is because they use heuristics to flag everything that is not widely known. Click keep or run anyway when asked.
