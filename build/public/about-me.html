            My name is Eero Lehtinen. I'm <span id="age">19</span> year old Finnish man passionately interested in
            creating software.
            As a tiny kid I was baffled how computers could know only using electric signals where the mouse is or in which
            order to show pixels.
            I wanted to find out.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 7th grade I was introduced to Scratch in a programming class.
            I created my first simple games and was instantly hooked.
            After that, I have been studying computer programming on my own.
        </p>
        <p>
            I graduated <span class="tooltip"><span class="tooltiptext">Three years of optional education<br>starting after
                    nine years of<br>compulsory education in Finland</span>lukio</span> in 2018 with excellent results from
            the matriculation examination.
            I got an <span class="tooltip"><span class="tooltiptext">Laudatur:<br>top 5% of all candidates</span>L</span> in
            advanced math, English and chemistry.
            Also, I got an <span class="tooltip"><span class="tooltiptext">Eximia cum laude approbatur:<br>top 15% of all
                    candidates</span>E</span> in Finnish and physics.
            I got quickly selected to the Tampere University of Technology to study information technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            My personal studies haven't gone to waste: I have made multiple intriguing personal projects on my own.
            They are very diverse ranging from simple browser extensions running on JavaScript to complex C++ multiplayer
            games requiring intricate networking.
        </p>
        <p>
            I would say that perseverance and analytical thinking are my best features.
            Moreover, I'm not easily discouraged by early failures when starting new tasks.
            Some math problems may take three hours and multiple failed attempts, but I'm always determined to find the
            right answer.
