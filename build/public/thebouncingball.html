            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                My first ever game released to the public web.
                It took months to make because I basically started from zero.
                We had a single programming course in school that taught only the most basic things like the existence of
                if-statements.
            </p>
            <p>
                All my learning would happen by encountering a problem and then watching an YouTube video about it.
                This strategy worked fine and I learned a lot about the basics of programming: variables, loops, classes, data
                types, operators, etc.
                I think the game turned out fine, but graphical design wasnâ€™t really my thing back then.
                The visuals especially in the menus look straight out of 2005.
